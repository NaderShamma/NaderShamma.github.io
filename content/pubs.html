      <h4>Abstract:</h4>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have shown great promise in the field of medicine and healthcare. This paper seeks to understand how AI and ML have
        been applied to the realm of patient care within the context of chronic disease, with a specific focus on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). First we present an overview of IBD, highlighting
        the nature of the disease and some of the challenges the various stakeholders face within the framework of outpatient care. Then we outline the current state of research into the application of AI
        and ML in general clinical care and in relation to IBD. After which we explore how both AI and ML have been utilized to help with the outpatient treatment of chronic illnesses which share
        similar challenges to that of IBD, such as Diabetes, mental health conditions and Parkinson â€™s disease, so as to gain precedent into how similar techniques may be used to assist in IBD outpatient
        support. Finally, we discuss the work that has passed and explore the prospect of future research into the field.

      <h4>Abstract:</h4>
      <p>
        Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an incurable chronic illness needing ongoing outpatient treatment and support. This paper identifies a number of challenges faced by the various stakeholders of the illness, much of which is rooted in a need for more information on how lifestyle, in a broad sense, impacts the disease and explores the potential to utilise smartphones to address some of the identified concerns. Mobile Health (m-Health) is a growing field, with smartphones being widely adopted across the healthcare arena. We identify an appetite among IBD patients for a smartphone solution which aids in the self-management of the disease and assists in communicating their needs to their respective clinical teams. Several examples of how smartphones have been utilised to aid in the treatment and management of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and some mental health conditions, which share similar challenges to that of IBD were explored, giving precedent as to how the technology could be utilised in the context of IBD. From the evidence at hand, we propose that smartphones provide a promising opportunity to develop a tool to aid in the treatment and management of IBD and outline the scope of future research into the field.
