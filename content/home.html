      <h2>How you will be helping:</h2>
      <p>
        By filling out this survey you will help us get a much better understanding of who IBD patients are, what challenges they face and how we can help. Furthermore we hope to use this information in addition to information gathered from other studies to develop a virtual patient to simulate someone with IBD so that we may fully test any application that is being built.

        <p>Our aim is to understand how and if mobile health (smartphones and smart wearables) can be utilised to help outpatients better manage their illness. Our objective is to develop a system that not only helps patients track their condition but also offers them decision support when it comes to managing their health.</p>

We want to understand how the illness is affecting you, how you currently self manage your illness, any challenges you face and what features you as a patient would find most beneficial from an application developed to help you manage your condition.

          My name Nader, I am a Computing Systems MSc student at Nottingham Trent University, a software engineer and a fellow IBD sufferer having lived with Crohn's Disease for over 10 years. My aim is to build a smart app to help other IBD patients, like myself, better manage their illness so they can live a comfortable life in remission for longer and with far fewer flareups.

          Yes. Even though you are answering this survey anonymously we will ask two special questions which you can use to identify yourself if you wish to withdraw (see section 3). These questions include "Enter the name of a memorable childhood movie." and "Enter the name of a memorable city, town or place." If you wish to withdraw simply email us via nader.al-shamma022015[at]my.ntu.ac.uk with the answer to those two questions and you will be removed from the survey results. Please note you must state that you wish to withdraw before 14th August 2017 to ensure you information can be removed before work is submitted.
